# Organize-Files-by-Format
Overview
The "Organize Files by Format" script is a Python program designed to help you automatically organize files in a given folder based on their file extensions. It uses multithreading to efficiently move files into folders named after their corresponding file formats. The script also provides the option to sort files within each format folder using a custom sorting order if required.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this program is to streamline the process of organizing files in a folder, especially when you have a large number of files with various file extensions. By running this script, you can achieve a well-organized folder structure where files are categorized based on their formats, making it easier to locate and manage files.

# How to Use
To use the "Organize Files by Format" script, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository containing the script to your local machine.

Install Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The script is compatible with Python 3. x.

Install Dependencies: There are no external dependencies required for this script. All the necessary modules are part of the Python standard library.

Adjust Configuration: Open the script in a text editor and modify the following variables as needed:

folder_path: Set the absolute path of the folder you want to organize. Make sure to use the appropriate file separator for your operating system (e.g., "/" for Linux, "\" for Windows).
num_threads: You can adjust the number of threads based on your machine's capabilities. Be cautious of very high thread counts as it might cause resource contention.
sorting_order: If you want to customize the sorting order, provide a sorting function to the variable. Otherwise, set it to None to use the default sorting order (based on the filename).
skip_existing: Set this to True if you want to skip files that already exist in their target format folders. Set it to False if you want to overwrite existing files.
Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, 
and execute the following command:

sort_files_by_extension.py
<code>driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "input")</code>

Observe Progress
The script will display the progress of the file organization, indicating the percentage of completion. The files will be moved into their respective format folders concurrently, making the process efficient.
View Logs and Results: After the script completes execution, you will find the organized files in their respective format folders within the provided folder path. Any errors encountered during the process will be logged in the organize_files_errors.log file.

# Precautions and Considerations
When using the "Organize Files by Format" script, keep the following points in mind:

Backup Important Files
Before running the script, make sure you have a backup of any critical files in the target folder. While the script aims to organize files without data loss, unexpected issues may occur.

Sorting Order Customization: If you need to sort files within each format folder based on specific criteria, customize the sorting_order function accordingly. Incorrect sorting functions might lead to unexpected results.

Multithreading Considerations: Be cautious when setting the num_threads value. Very high thread counts might consume excessive system resources and could lead to performance issues or even crashes. It's best to test with a moderate number of threads first and observe the system's behavior.

File Overwriting: If skip_existing is set to False, be aware that files with the same names in their respective format folders will be overwritten. Ensure this behavior aligns with your intentions.

# Prerequisites
To run the "Organize Files by Format" script, you need the following:

Python: The script requires Python 3. x installed on your system.

Operating System: The script is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

File System Access: Ensure that you have permissions to access the folder specified in folder_path and that you have write permissions to the destination folders.

# Common Expected Problems and Troubleshooting
No Files Moved: If the script completes without moving any files, check the folder_path variable to ensure it points to the correct folder containing the files you want to organize.

Incorrect Sorting: If the files within the format folders are not sorted as expected, review the sorting_order function. Make sure it returns the appropriate values for sorting.

Permission Errors: If you encounter permission-related errors, ensure that the script has the necessary read and write permissions for the specified folders.

Crashes or Freezes: High thread counts (num_threads) might cause crashes or freezes due to resource contention. Try reducing the thread count if you experience any issues.

Disk Space: Keep an eye on your disk space, especially when organizing a large number of files. Ensure that you have sufficient free space on your drive to accommodate the organized files.

# Conclusion
The "Organize Files by Format" script provides an efficient way to organize files in a given folder based on their file extensions. With multi-threading and optional sorting capabilities, the script can handle large-scale file organization tasks effectively. By following the provided instructions and precautions, you can seamlessly manage your files and keep your folders tidy.
